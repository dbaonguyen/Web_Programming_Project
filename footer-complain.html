                     <p>is explained and adjusted in accordance with the Regulations for the Management of Lazada Marketplace Operations dated June 3, 2022, as amended and supplemented from time to time ("Operating Regulations"). Capitalized terms in this dispute resolution and complaint process shall have the meanings as defined in the Operating Regulations.</p>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Process for Domestic Seller's Products</h4>
                     <p>(a) Lazada and the Seller are responsible for receiving complaints and assisting Customers regarding transactions on the Lazada Marketplace. In the event of a dispute, Lazada emphasizes negotiated solutions and mediation between parties to maintain Member confidence in the quality of Lazada Marketplace services and follows these steps:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Step 1:</strong> Customers file complaints about Products through the customer care hotline at <a href="tel:19001007">19001007</a> or through the online chat function at <a href="https://www.lazada.vn/contact">www.lazada.vn/contact</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Step 2:</strong> Lazada's customer care department will receive Customer complaints and transfer them to the Seller. Depending on the nature and severity of the complaint, Lazada may take specific actions to assist the Customer in resolving the dispute. For transactions involving more than two (2) parties on the Lazada Marketplace, Lazada will be the point of contact for receiving and resolving complaints from Buyers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Step 3:</strong> In cases beyond Lazada's capacity and jurisdiction, Customers may request that the matter be resolved by the relevant state authority.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>(b) Lazada respects and diligently complies with consumer protection laws. Therefore, Sellers are required to provide complete, accurate, truthful, and detailed information about their Products listed on the Lazada Marketplace. Any fraudulent or deceptive business practices are condemned and fully liable under the law.</p>
                     <p>(c) All parties, including Sellers, Customers, and logistics providers, have a responsibility to actively participate in resolving the disputed issues. Relevant parties must provide documents and authenticating materials related to the conflict. Lazada will be responsible for providing information related to the parties involved in the dispute if requested by the relevant parties.</p>
                     <p>(d) After the parties have resolved the dispute, they must report back to Lazada. In cases where the transaction dispute results from Seller's fault, Lazada may issue warnings, suspend accounts, or transfer the case to the relevant state authority, depending on the severity of the violation. Lazada may also terminate and remove all listings of the Seller's Products that violate Lazada Marketplace rules. Additionally, the Seller is responsible for reasonable compensation or reimbursement to the Customer based on mutual agreement.</p>
                     <p>(e) If, through mutual agreement, the dispute cannot be resolved, the parties have the right to seek intervention from the relevant state authority to protect their legal interests.</p>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Process for Products of Foreign Sellers</h4>

                     </ul>
                     <p>(c) The process for receiving and resolving complaints is as follows:</p>
                     <ol>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Step 3:</strong> After the complaint resolution period ends, Lazada will inform the Customer of the complaint resolution result. In cases where the Customer's complaint is accepted or has a basis, Lazada will refund the purchase price of the Product to the Customer. In cases where the Customer's complaint has no basis, Lazada will notify the Customer.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
